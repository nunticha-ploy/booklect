Subject to some restrictions, you can, at any time, refuse to consent, or continue to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of their personal information by notifying us using the email address below in the ‘Contact Us’ section. Withdrawal of consent may impact our ability to provide or continue to provide services.
                        <br />
                        Customers cannot refuse collection, use and disclosure of their personal information if such information is required to:

                        be collected, used or disclosed as required by any law;
                        fulfill the terms of any contractual agreement; and

                        Right of Access under PIPEDA

                        PIPEDA gives you a general right to access the PII held by businesses subject to this law. Under PIPEDA, you need to make your access request in writing and pay a minimal fee of $30.00.

                        If any organizational fees seem unjust, you have the right to complain about this. We retain the right to decide how we disclose the copies of your PII to you. We will take all necessary measures to fulfill your request in 30 days from receipt, otherwise we must inform you of our inability to do so before the 30-day timeframe if:

                        meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with our business activities; or
                        the time required to undertake consultations necessary to respond to the request would make it impractical to meet the time limit.

                        We can also extend the time limit for the length of time required to convert the personal information into an alternative format. In these circumstances, we will advise you of the delay within the first 30 days and explain the reason for it.

                        Right of rectification under PIPEDA

                        You may request a correction to any factual errors or omissions within your PII. We would ask you to provide some evidence to back up your claim. Under PIPEDA, an organization must amend the information, as required, if you successfully demonstrate that it’s incomplete or inaccurate.

                        You may contact us at any time, using the information provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy if you believe your PII on our systems is incorrect or incomplete.

                        If we cannot agree on changing the information, you have the right to have your concerns recorded with the Office of the Privacy Commission of Canada.

                        Compliance with PIPEDA’s Ten Principles of Privacy

                        This privacy policy complies with the PIPEDA’s requirements and ten principles of privacy, which are as follows:

                        Limiting collection. Personal information collected will be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by [Business name] only.
                        Limiting use, disclosure and retention.

                        Openness. We will make our policies and practices relating to the collection and management of personal information readily available upon request, including our brochures or other information that explain our policies, standards, or codes.
                        Customer access. We will inform customers of the existence, use and disclosure of their personal information and will provide access to their personal information, subject to any legal restrictions. We may require written requests for access to personal information and in most cases, will respond within 30 days of receipt of such requests.
