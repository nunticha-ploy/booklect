                    <li>“Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when using or participating in any of our services and promotions.</li>
                    <li>“Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically sent by your devices in the course of accessing our products and services.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Security of Your Personal Information</h2>
                When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

                You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the bounds of our services. For example, ensuring any passwords associated with accessing your personal information and accounts are secure and confidential.
                <br />
                <h2>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h2>
                We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy. For example, if you have provided us with personal information as part of creating an account with us, we may retain this information for the duration your account exists on our system. If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.
                <br />
                However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.

                <h2>Additional Disclosures for Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) Compliance (Canada)</h2>
                <h3>Customer Data Rights</h3>
                Although PIPEDA does not contain an extensive set of consumer rights, it does grant consumers the right to:
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Access the personal information organizations hold about them;</li>
                    <li>Correct any inaccurate or outdated personal information the organization hold about them (or, if this is not possible, delete the inaccurate personal information)</li>
                    <li>Withdraw consent for any activities for which they have consented (e.g. direct marketing or cookies</li></ul>
                <h3>Right to Withdraw Consent</h3>
                Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for a specific purpose. Subject to some restrictions, you can, at any time, refuse to consent, or continue to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of their personal information by notifying us using the email address below in the ‘Contact Us’ section. Withdrawal of consent may impact our ability to provide or continue to provide services.
                <br />
                Customers cannot refuse collection, use and disclosure of their personal information if such information is required to:
                <ul>
                    <li>be collected, used or disclosed as required by any law;</li>
                    <li>fulfill the terms of any contractual agreement; and</li>
                    <li>be collected, used or disclosed as required by any regulators including self regulatory organizations</li>
                </ul>
                While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time, we cannot recall any email we have already sent. If you have any further enquiries about how to withdraw your consent, please feel free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.
                <br />
                <h3>Right of Access under PIPEDA</h3>
                PIPEDA gives you a general right to access the PII held by businesses subject to this law. Under PIPEDA, you need to make your access request in writing and pay a minimal fee of $30.00.
                <br />
                If any organizational fees seem unjust, you have the right to complain about this. We retain the right to decide how we disclose the copies of your PII to you. We will take all necessary measures to fulfill your request in 30 days from receipt, otherwise we must inform you of our inability to do so before the 30-day timeframe if:
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with our business activities; or</li>
                    <li>the time required to undertake consultations necessary to respond to the request would makeit impractical to meet the time limit.</li>
                </ul>
                We can also extend the time limit for the length of time required to convert the personal information into an alternative format. In these circumstances, we will advise you of the delay within the first 30 days and explain the reason for it.
                <br />
                <h3>Right of rectification under PIPEDA</h3>
                You may request a correction to any factual errors or omissions within your PII. We would ask you to provide some evidence to back up your claim. Under PIPEDA, an organization must amend the information, as required, if you successfully demonstrate that it’s incomplete or inaccurate.
                <br />
                You may contact us at any time, using the information provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy if you believe your PII on our systems is incorrect or incomplete.
                <br />
                If we cannot agree on changing the information, you have the right to have your concerns recorded with the Office of the Privacy Commission of Canada.
                <br />
